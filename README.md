In the begining robot goes diagonosis because robot doest't carry any sample and current locaction different from diagonasis. When come to diagonasis iterate all samples and find max healted sample. Check it is not carryed by other robot. If sample free collect sample and because of there is carryed sample and current location different from molecules move to molecules module. In every step on molecules module, algorithym checks sample's needed molecules. It's continues until all needed molecules are took. If all carried number of molecules for all molecule types are not smaller than samples number of molecules, checks current location with laboratory. If current location different from target move to laboratory. If robot already on laboratory module, connect to module. Then all steps repeates.
